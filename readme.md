List of experiments to try out for a whole year to stay on top of latest research. wiil be updating as time goes. I should have been doing this a year ago.

1. Add reasoning to small model
2. pretrain small model and then add reasoning
3. 50% pre-train + reasoning skill + again pre-train further? check outcome.
4. Priming LLM just enough to trigger reasoning and give a non-differentiable memory.
